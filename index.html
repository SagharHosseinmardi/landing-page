			<h2>About me:</h2>
			<p class="frame-white">I have permanently moved from Iran to the United Kingdom in late 2019.<br>
			<br>
			Prior to this, I graduated with a B.A in Fashion design from “The Azad Tehran university” in Iran (2009), a “University Diploma in Law” from London Metropolitan University (2012), and a Foundation Course in Business from Bellerbys College in London (2009).<br>
			<br>
			Having lived in Iran for 20 years along with my college and university education in the United Kingdom gives me the opportunity to better understand the people from different social and cultural backgrounds, which helped me alot during my study in Fashion Design.</p>

			<h3>Who is a Fashion designer and What they do:</h3>
			<p class="frame-white">Fashion Designers create clothing and accessories.<br>
			<br>
			They often are specialized in a certain area, such as sportswear or children’s clothes.<br>
			<br>
			Typical Fashion Designer duties include: discussing requirements with clients, using client briefs for instructions, updating their knowledge of the latest trends, liaising with suppliers, organizing fashion presentations, producing patterns and prints, estimating costs, supervising production, and creating mood boards.<br>
			<br>
			Fashion Designers often use computer-aided design software during their work.</p>
